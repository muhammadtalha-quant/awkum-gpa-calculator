The AWKUM GPA Calculator is designed to assist students in calculating their SGPA and CGPA accurately according to the university's grading policy.

## Core Features

    -   Ideal for students who already know their SGPA for each semester.
    -   Input: Semester SGPA and Total Credit Hours.
    -   Output: Cumulative GPA (CGPA).
-   **Expert Mode**:
    -   Detailed calculation starting from subject marks.
    -   Input: Subject Name, Course Code, Credit Hours, and Marks (Obtained).

### 2. Automatic Grading
-   The app implements the official AWKUM grading table.

### 3. Transcript Export
-   **Unofficial Transcript**: Users can generate a PDF transcript.
-   **Customization**: Includes student photo, personal details, and a breakdown of all semesters and subjects (available in Expert Mode).

### 4. Validation & Constraints
